<-- Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. 

For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.

Add the following within the head element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

Next, you want to center the div horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the div element within the body element.
