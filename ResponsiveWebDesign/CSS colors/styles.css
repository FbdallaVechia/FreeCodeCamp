/*Your marker would look better if it was centered on the page. An easy way to do that is with the margin shorthand property.

In the last project, you set the margin area of elements separately with properties like margin-top and margin-left. The margin shorthand property makes it easy to set multiple margin areas at the same time.

To center your marker on the page, set its margin property to auto. This sets margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left all to auto.


Step 36
A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

In the rgb function for the .one CSS rule, set the red value to the max of 255 to produce pure red. In the rgb function for .two CSS rule, set the values for green and blue to the max of 255 to produce cyan.

Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

First, in the h1 rule, use the rgb function to set its background color to cyan.

Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

There are several other important color combinations outside of complementary colors, but you'll learn those a bit later.

For now, use the rgb function in the .two rule to set the background-color to black.

.two {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

.three {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}

Os valores de RGB v√£o de 0 a 255...

A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

In the .green CSS rule, set the background-color property to a hex color code with the values 00 for red, FF for green, and 00 blue.

You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

The linear-gradient function is very flexible -- here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial:

linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl.

Now you'll apply a red-to-green gradient along a 90 degree line to the first marker.

First, in the .red CSS rule, set the background property to linear-gradient(), and pass it the value 90deg as the gradientDirection.

Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:

linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);


Step 73
Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.

With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.

Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is.

You've already set sleeve's opacity with a named color and the opacity property, but you can add an alpha channel to the other CSS color properties.

You're already familiar with using the rgb function to set colors. To add an alpha channel to an rgb color, use the rgba function instead.

The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel:

rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);



All HTML elements have borders, though they're usually set to none by default. With CSS, you can control all aspects of an element's border, and set the border on all sides, or just one side at a time. For a border to be visible, you need to set its width and style.
Borders have several styles to choose from. You can make your border a solid line, but you can also use a dashed or dotted line if you prefer. Solid border lines are probably the most common.
The border-left shorthand property lets you to set the left border's width, style, and color at the same time.
Here is the syntax:

border-left: width style color;

The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:

box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;

As you can see, you added a simple red shadow around your marker that's 5 pixels to the right, and 5 pixels down.

But what if you wanted to position your shadow on the opposite side? You can do that by using negative values for offsetX and offsetY.

Notice that the edges of the shadow are sharp. This is because there is an optional blurRadius value for the box-shadow property:

box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color;
If a blurRadius value isn't included, it defaults to 0 and produces sharp edges. The higher the value of blurRadius, the greater the blurring effect is.
But what if you wanted to expand the shadow out further? You can do that with the optional spreadRadius value:

box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;Like blurRadius, spreadRadius defaults to 0 if it isn't included.
